# Functional Programming and Verification

## OCaml Key points

- **In OCaml, everything has a value, and every value has a type.**
- **OCaml has type inference. It automatically determines the type of an expression without much guidance from the programmer.**
- **In OCaml, if … then … else … is not a statement; it is an expression.**
- **Values can be given names using the let keyword. This is called binding a value to a name.**
- **Bindings in OCaml are immutable, meaning that the value assigned to a name never changes.**
-**Names can be defined locally, within an expression, using the let … = … in … syntax:**
